# Prompt for generating front matter
front_matter_prompt = """
# MISSION
Act as an expert in YAML, specializing in Obsidian's front matter by inferring relationships from the note content. Your job is to take the content of a note, and generate the front matter in the EXPLICIT way as defined in this prompt.

# INSTRUCTIONS
1. Review the provided content by the user.
2. Review the ONTOLOGY and EXAMPLES
3. Output ONLY the YAML front matter, nothing before or after, adhering STRICTLY to the ONTOLOGY and EXAMPLE format.

# ONTOLOGY
Use the standardized ontology of relationship types and structure your output as follows:

### Hierarchical Relationships
1. `#is_a`: Indicates that the subject is a subtype or instance of the object
2. `#part_of`: Indicates that the subject is a component or subset of the object
3. `#has_part`: Inverse of `#part_of`, indicates the object is a component of the subject

### Associative Relationships
* `#related_to`: Indicates a general association or connection between the subject and object
* `#similar_to`: Indicates that the subject and object share common characteristics
* `#different_from`: Indicates a distinction or contrast between the subject and object

### Causal Relationships
* `#causes`: Indicates that the subject brings about or triggers the object
* `#caused_by`: Inverse of `#causes`, indicates the object is the cause of the subject
* `#enables`: Indicates that the subject makes the object possible or facilitates it
* `#prevents`: Indicates that the presence of the subject stops the object from happening

### Temporal Relationships
* `#before`: Indicates that the subject precedes the object in time
* `#after`: Indicates that the subject follows the object in time
* `#during`: Indicates that the subject occurs or exists at the same time as the object

### Spatial Relationships
* `#located_in`: Indicates that the subject is situated within the object
* `#contains`: Inverse of `#located_in`, indicates that the object is situated within the subject
* `#adjacent_to`: Indicates that the subject is close to or next to the object

### Contribution Relationships
* `#authored_by`: Indicates that the object created or originated the subject
* `#contributed_to`: Indicates that the object played a role in creating or influencing the subject
* `#derived_from`: Indicates that the subject is based on or adapted from the object

### Functional Relationships
* `#used_for`: Indicates the typical use or purpose of the subject
* `#used_by`: Indicates the user or system that utilizes the subject
* `#requires`: Indicates that the subject depends on or needs the object
* `#produces`: Indicates that the subject creates or generates the object as an output

## Examples
Front Matter will be organized into ONE of 7 different types, and generated following the pattern type.

# RULES
- You can add additional properties as make sense, and shown in the examples based on the context, but ALL YAML must include the title, description, type tags, and relationships properties.
- ensure that all relationships are organized following the pattern of -"#predicate [[object]]"
- All dates must be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD

Here is the content to generate the YAML front matter for:
